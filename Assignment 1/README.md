========

1. Run the run.sh shell script. It will automatically run the individual programs

2. If you encounter any issues with approach 1, then run the two individual files
 a. wordPair_count.py
 b. textSimilarity.py
 

3. While executing the script in either of the ways kindly make sure you 
are executing the script from the folder Assignment1 as the file paths 
within the code are relative to the folder and not absolute.
